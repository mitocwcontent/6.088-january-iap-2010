| 1 | Motivation for using C/C++; discussion of where C and C++ sit in the abstraction hierarchy; writing our first C programs | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_088iap10_lec01)) | &nbsp; |
| 2 | The logistics of memory manipulation in C (pointers, structs) | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_088iap10_lec02)) | ([ZIP]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lec02)) (This ZIP file contains: 1 .c file and 1 .h file.) |
| 3 | More advanced memory manipulation in C. We'll show double linked-list insert in place, inserting into a linked list using a double pointer, corner cases of using memory (when we actually need heap allocation), etc. | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_088iap10_lec03)) | &nbsp; |
| 4 | Introduction to C++; encapsulation: classes, namespaces, constructors and destructors; memory management in C++ (new, delete); operator overloading and standard input/output | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_088iap10_lec04)) | ([ZIP]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lec04)) (This Zip file contains: 3 .cc files and 2 .h files.) |
| 5 | Inheritance and polymorphism; templates; standard library containers | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_088iap10_lec05)) | ([ZIP]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lec05)) (This ZIP file contains: 4 .cc files and 3 .h files.) |
| 6 | Tricks of the trade. Things people might see in interviews, etc. Review and discussion of the covered topics, Q&A. | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_088iap10_lec06)) |
